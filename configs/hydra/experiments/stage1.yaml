# Single Stage Projector Training (SLAM-ASR Methodology)
# This configuration implements the simple training approach from the paper:
# "An Embarrassingly Simple Approach for LLM with Strong ASR Capacity"
# - Frozen Speech Encoder (HuBERT)
# - Frozen LLM Decoder (Smollm3-3B)
# - Only the Projector is trained.

defaults:
  - override /model: large
  - override /data: loquacious_clean
  - override /training: production

# Model configuration - the freezing logic is hard-coded in asr_modeling.py
model:
  decoder_model_name: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B  # Base model without chat templates
  encoder_model_name: facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft

  # Projector configuration
  projector_hidden_dim: 2048
  audio_downsample_rate: 5  # Concatenate every 5 frames for downsampling

# Training Configuration (Aligned with Paper Section 3.3)
training:
  # Learning rate and scheduler
  learning_rate: 1.0e-4
  warmup_steps: 500
  lr_scheduler_type: cosine

  # Optimization
  weight_decay: 0.0
  max_grad_norm: 1.0  # Increased from 1.0 - less aggressive clipping for projector training


  # Evaluation and checkpointing
  eval_steps: 500
  save_steps: 500
  logging_steps: 25

  # Training duration
  max_steps: 20000

  # Reproducibility
  seed: 42
  ignore_data_skip: true

# Early stopping configuration
early_stopping:
  patience: 20
  threshold: 0.001

# Data augmentation - DISABLED per paper requirements
# The paper EXPLICITLY states "without any data augmentation"
